//! Qualified public-specification pin, manifest parsing, and drift detection.
//!
//! The public TIDAS specification is produced by `tiangong-lca/tidas-spec` and
//! consumed here as one immutable candidate archive. The identity of that
//! archive is recorded as Rust constants so it cannot drift as data: the
//! committed `assets/spec/spec-manifest.json`, the 39 public assets it binds,
//! and the archive itself are all checked against these constants.
//!
//! Nothing in this module mutates the repository. Import lives in
//! [`crate::spec_import`] and consumes the validation results produced here.
